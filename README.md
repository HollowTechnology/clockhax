Clockwork is no longer officially supported. It hasn't been for a long time now, and frankly I wouldn't want to support this codebase much more (it's not particularly good.)

Now that Glitch is shutting down their free hosting (which is frankly tragic), the Clockwork store has been shut down, removing most of Clockwork's functionality. I have nowhere to host this other than Glitch at this time, and frankly Clockwork's (and Redstone Network's) heyday was two years ago.

Thanks for everything. I hope to see you soon.

This includes Render, Vercel, Netlify, Glitch, Replit, Stormkit, Hop, Github/Gitlab Pages, and more. You should be able to find more detailed instructions on your chosen provider's website.

  You can also use <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/">FreeDNS</a> to get free subdomains (only if you have a home computer, also don't use the short ones because most are taken)
